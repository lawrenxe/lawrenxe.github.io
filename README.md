# Hygraph Microblog Starter Next

This is a demo that corresponds to [this article](https://hygraph.com/blog/lazy-load-content-astro-hygraph-pagination) about Hygraph pagination.

## Getting Started

For the quickest start, use the button below to clone the Hygraph project with schemas and content.

[![Clone project](https://hygraph.com/button)](https://app.hygraph.com/clone/17eb970b42d544c595b5772ba3614551?name=Microblog)

For a slightly slower start, you'll need a new Hygraph project with a `post` schema that has a `slug` and `content` field. `content` should be a Rich Text field.

To run the site locally run the following commands in your CLI.

```
npx degit git@github.com:hygraph/hygraph-next-microblog-starter.git

cd hygraph-next-microblog-starter && npm install
```
